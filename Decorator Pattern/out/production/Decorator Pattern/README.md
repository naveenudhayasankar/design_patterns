THE DECORATOR PATTERN: Closed for modification, Open for extension. 

The Decorator Pattern allows you to write your code and avoid modification, while still
extending that code if needed. In other words, design your core code so that it does not have to be
modified a lot, but may be extended as needed.

Instead of using external algorithms, this design pattern is all about using wrapper code to
extend your core code.

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators
provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

When you use wrapper code to extend your core
functionality, and you donâ€™t need to modify that core functionality, you are
essentially decorating the code.
